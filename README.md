Business intelligence dashboards are information management and data visualization solutions used to analyze your data. Content creators can use interactive elements like filters and actions to combine charts, graphs and reports in a single screen for snapshot overviews. Dashboards are one of the most popular capabilities of BI platforms because they present easily understandable data analysis, allow you to customize which information you want to view, and provide a way to share the results of your analysis with others.

•	The purpose of a BI dashboard Dashboards are integral to an organizations’ business intelligence strategy. They should be purpose-built and designed to analyze data from key datasets, to improve business decisions. Instead of analysts manually compiling spreadsheets, modern BI platforms can access, analyze, display, and share data via web-based dashboards. With a powerful, automated business intelligence tool, stakeholders can build dashboards to review, draw conclusions, and act.

BI dashboards vs. BI reports
•	Dashboards and reports are critical for business intelligence, and dashboards can help users understand complex reports. Dashboards are ideal for stakeholders who need at-a-glance overviews of performance. Reports are for stakeholders who need more details and who want to slice and dice data to uncover insights.


Key differences between dashboards and reports

•	Dashboards and reports can work together to give a comprehensive view of trends and insights, but they are different. Dashboards can be updated in near-real time using cloud-based technology. They tend to be visual and interactive, allowing the user to engage with the information and create their own analyses. Reports, on the other hand, are static—they offer detail, but the end user must extract insights from a compilation of data.
